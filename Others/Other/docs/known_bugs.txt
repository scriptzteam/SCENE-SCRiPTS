Here are a few bugs that we know of but don't have time for/don't know how to
fix or replicate. Most other bugs get fixed immediately.

Legend:
? - probably fixed, test to make sure and let us know (you can contact us 
    at #glftpd@EFnet iRC or mail the report to bloody_a at glftpd.com)
* - need fixing

------------------------------------------------------------

?) on some bsd systems, logging off doesn't end the process, so you have lots of
   ghosts left.  is this a bsd bug? it seems to work fine on other bsd systems.
   - was it caused by the lastonline bug? that one has been fixed

?) some systems have a strange problem with certain users idling forever. it
   appears that the idle timer doesn't disconnect those users when it hits zero,
   even though it works fine for most other users and for all users on most
   other systems. this is still a mystery being investigated.
   - still mysterious, but solved with killghost.c?

?) site renuser only allows 11 characters or so
   - this part of code is REALLY messy, needs rewriting

*) sometimes xferlog logs negative transfer time - so far the best explanation
   of this is that sometimes the box moves backwards in time during transfer :)
   - can't reliably replicate

*) the timezone setting doesn't change time on new files/directories, and was
   reported to also cause major slowdowns with cookies for some people.
   - not worth fixing, since the localtime fix works 100%, right?
