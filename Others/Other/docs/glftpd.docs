glFTPD Docs for v2.00
	Original docs composed by icetrain
	Maintained by: Archimede #glftpd (efnet)
	Maintained by: Usurper 
	Maintained by: Bloody_A #glftpd (efnet)

NOTE:   These docs are provided to you in respect that you know linux basics.
	If you come in #glftpd without reading these docs or not knowing LINUX
	very well, you WILL get flamed and this is your own fault. We in
	#glftpd do not have enough time to support glftpd AND linux. Be smart
	and buy a LINUX book..it does help a lot.

NOTE:  If you have a suggestion or correction, please feel free to let us know.

  This document describes how to install, and covers some frequently asked
  questions and answers regarding the glftpd server.  They are compiled
  from various sources including the glftpd Forum <http://www.glftpd.com>
  and the glftpd IRC channel on efnet (#glftpd).

  The latest version of this document can always be found at
  http://www.glftpd.com.

  Please read the changelog and faq as well as looking at this document.

PREREQUISITES:

You need the following to successfully install and use glftpd:
- root password
- System V ipc support in kernel (shared memory)
- Disk drive with UNIX-like file system (like ext2/ext3 in linux)






.------------------------.
| 1. Installation        |
`------------------------'





*** NOTE: installgl.sh is an install script that eliminates the following
	tasks. Try using that before attempting to do this by hand.
*** NOTE: If running this script more then once you will get an error, please
	do the following to remove it and start over again:
	    edit /etc/inetd.conf, /etc/services and remove all glftpd instances.
	    rm -rf /glftpd /etc/glftpd.conf

1. Extract the archive to your root directory.
   (tar zxvf glftp-XXX.x.xx.tgz -C /)

*** NOTE: Steps 2-5 are only needed for scripts, like zipscript, to work.  They are not necessary for glftpd itself.  Also, if your rootpath is /, you can skip these steps.

2. Copy the required library files and the 'ldconfig' utility to your ftp-structure.
   (cp /lib/* /glftpd/lib; cp /sbin/ldconfig /glftpd/bin)

* NOTE: Depending on your OS, your libs maybe be in /usr/lib or other directories

3. Now do this:
   (cd /glftpd/dev; mknod null c 1 3; chmod 666 null)
   (cd /glftpd/dev; mknod zero c 1 5; chmod 666 zero)
* NOTE: This is the syntax for linux; other OSes may have different syntax. Do ls -l /dev/null on your box to see which numbers you need (exmp: fbsd uses "2 2" for null and "2 12" for zero, instead of "1 3" and "1 5")

4. Create 'ld.so.cache' in your ftp-structure.
   (chroot /glftpd /bin/ldconfig)

   If this doesn't work, try: chroot /glftpd /bin/ldconfig /lib
   (some systems, like OpenBSD, use /usr/lib as default path). You may also
   need to copy ld.so to /glftpd/usr/libexec on OpenBSD and similar - see where
   that file is on your system and replicate this path under /glftpd.

   NOTE: /glftpd/etc/ld.so.cache is what this is under LINUX. Other OSes use other files, for example
         OBSD uses /glftpd/var/run/ld.so.hints, so you need to create /glftpd/var/run. Do a
         "man ldconfig" and check what it creates, then create that directory under /glftpd
         before performing step #4.
	
* NOTE: This will only work right if the libs are copied right. You can be anywhere when performing
* this task, a good idea would be to cd /glftpd/etc and ls after you have typed this command to make
* sure that ld.so.cache is there.

   You might need to create ld.so.conf in /glftpd/etc and put "/lib" inside.
	
   You will probably get an error-message like this, just ignore it:
   bin/ldconfig: warning: can't open /usr/lib (No such file or directory), skipping
   Ignore other errors that mention missing files or symlinks

   Check that '/glftpd/etc/ld.so.cache' (or whatever it is on your OS) exists,
   if not go back to step 2 and try again.

5. cp /bin/sh /glftpd/bin; cp /bin/kill /glftpd/bin; 
   cp /bin/cat /glftpd/bin; cp /bin/echo /glftpd/bin;
   cp /bin/grep /glftpd/bin; cp /bin/unzip /glftpd/bin
   cp /usr/bin/gunzip /glftpd/bin; cp /bin/bash /glftpd/bin

   Make sure all permissions are set correctly in '/glftpd/bin' and
   that your incoming directory is world-wide-read/writeable.
   (chmod -R 755 /glftpd/bin)
   (chmod -R 755 /glftpd/lib)
   (chmod 777 /glftpd/site/incoming)

* NOTE: If using bkpack you will need to follow what he has written in the faq.

6. Copy the config file to '/etc' and edit it to your likes.
   More about this below.

*** NOTE: DO NOT USE NOTEPAD OR MS-WORD TO EDIT THIS FILE ***
*** NOTE: Also get into the habit of using tabs for spaces ***
   (cp /glftpd/glftpd.conf /etc/glftpd.conf)

*VERY IMPORTANT* glftpd.conf is your server configuration file. you MUST edit this!!!!
* NOTE: READ all of this file..it has many variables that are easy to follow.

7. Add the following line to '/etc/inetd.conf':
   glftpd stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /glftpd/bin/glftpd -l -o -i
   (If your system uses xinetd instead of inetd, like Readhat7, you need to add an entry
    for xinetd instead. There is an example entry in README.xinetd)

   *NOTE* If you do not use tcpd then you need to use a bogus flag ('-' isn't
   needed in front) to make the first real option work (this is usually -l, so
   without the bogus flag logging to glftpd.log will not work).
   A good idea is to use the word 'glftpd':
   glftpd stream tcp nowait root /glftpd/bin/glftpd glftpd -l -o -i

   If you ARE using tcpd, make sure you modify hosts.allow to allow connections
   to glftpd (something like GLFTPD: ALL)
   
   The following switches can be used in inetd.conf:
   -B            This will only allow connections from the port bouncer
                 (connecting from localhost [127.0.0.1] will still work)
   -b            This allows connections from a port bouncer or direct connections.
   -e            This will use european week (Mon-Sun) when modifying stats
   -l            Logs new dirs,deleted dirs,nukes,unnukes,logins,logouts to
                 /glftpd/ftp-data/logs/glftpd.log and login.log in ascii.
   -L            Works just like -l, but it will always log creation and
                 deletion of directories to glftpd.log. The -l option only logs
                 those if they are in dirlog path (specified in glftpd.conf).
                 Most likely, you want to use -l, this is for special cases.
   -i            Logs uploads to /glftpd/ftp-data/logs/xferlog.
   -I            Disables ident lookups. Note that if you use tcpd, it will do
                 an ident lookup independently from glftpd.
   -o            Logs downloads /glftpd/ftp-data/logs/xferlog. 
   -d            Logs connections and all user commands to system logs as debug
                 (usually /var/log/debug, but refer to your /etc/syslog.conf).
   -r <file>     Use alternate glftpd.conf file.
   -t <seconds>  Sets the default idle timeout period.
   -T <seconds>  Sets the maximum idle timeout period a user may select using
                 the 'site idle' command if he/she doesn't have a personal
                 idle time set (site change user idle_time xx).
   -n <#>        Number of DNS retries, 0 disables DNS resolving.
   -s <path>     The full path to the glstrings binary (default is /glftpd/bin/glstrings.bin)
                 Example: -s/home/glftpd/bin/myownglstrings.bin
   -x		 makes glftpd only log ips on errors. (by default everything will be logged)
   -X		 forces glftpd not to log ips (not even for error messages in login.log)


   Add the following line to '/etc/services'
   glftpd	<Port you want glftpd on>/tcp

* NOTE: e.g.: glftpd 8000/tcp # Glftpd
* NOTE: Do not initially put your ftpd on port 21...stick it on a really high port so you know it works *
* NOTE: DO NOT PUT THE PORT RIGHT NEXT TO ANOTHER PORT, SPACE THEM OUT BY AT LEAST 5-10 PORTS *

7.1 Read README.TLS, and set your certificate

8. Restart INETD.
   (killall -HUP inetd) or (kill -HUP <PID of inetd>
*** NOTE: This is only needed when modifying inetd.conf, glftpd.conf has nothing to do with inetd.  For changes in glftpd.conf to take effect, you need to relogin.

9. Login to your newly created site.
   Login/Pass = glftpd/glftpd
   Please note that you must use ftp to localhost since the ipmask
   on the predefined account 'glftpd' is *@127.0.0.1.
   (ftp localhost <Port you have chosen>)

### NOTE: For SECURITY reasons you will either need to delete this account or change the ip and password.

*** If you are getting a "421 Service not available" message or something similar, you didn't install glftpd correctly.  Check your system logs (you might need to configure your syslog to start logging errors and warnings - i believe redhat doesn't do that by default!, try man syslog.conf), glftpd logs, permissions, config file settings, and try installing again.

10. Now add your own account and enable the siteop flag.
   (site adduser <user> <password> <ident@ip>)
   (site change <user> flags +1)

*** NOTE: The 1 flag is NOT god mode...you must add any flags you wish to perform, those flags are listed later in this doc.

11. Set up a crontab entry for root to run the included 'reset' bin
	every night at midnight.
	Sample Entry.
	0 0 * * *       /glftpd/bin/reset

	(Reset is a binary that resets users' daily/weekly/monthly
	 upload/download/nuke statistics. Try reset -? for help. You do not
	 normally need any arguments, reset will make it's own decision on
	 what to reset based on the system date. If you use switches to reset
	 specific stats, this automated resetting will not kick in.)

12. Logs

	Log rotation won't be covered here - you should know how to do that.
	However, there are 2 utils that you should regularly use to keep
	your dirlog in shape (list of directories on site).
	- glupdate, to re-add moved directories to dirlog, or to add new
	  directories that were not created through glftpd.
	- olddirclean (olddirclean2 as of Nov 2000), to remove old entries from
	  your dirlog (when you move/delete directories) and to sort your
	  dirlog after glupdate runs.
	For more info, look in /glftpd/bin/sources.






.------------------------------------.
| II. Glftpd.conf                    |
`------------------------------------'





NOTE: All these variables should be in lower case in the config file -
      if you make them upper case glftpd won't see them. Order doesn't matter,
      you can add these anywhere in the file.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS:

	* If you want to use a space in an argument, you need to use
	[:space:] instead.  Glftpd will convert it to ' '.

	* When glftpd sees the character #, it will replace it with null
	(meaning everything that follows it will be disregarded). All
	comments should be done this way.

	* To represent the # character, use [:hash:].

	* You can use "include" to split the main config file into several
	pieces, kind of like it's done in C (but without the # in front). Just
	add a line "include /path/to/config.file" to glftpd.conf.

RECOGNIZED SETTINGS:

ifip IP [IP2 IP3 ...]
elseip
endifip
	Settings in glftpd.conf can be conditional - depending on the IP mask
	of the person connecting. The "ifip" setting takes one or more IP
	masks. If the connecting IP matches one of those masks, settings that
	follow (on lines below) will be used, until "elseip" or "endifip" is
	encountered. If the IP does not match any of the masks, settings that
	follow it will be ignored. If "elseip" is encountered, settings that
	follow it will be used instead.

	Nesting in the elseip part is ok, but I wouldn't recommend nesting in
	the if part, it might screw up.

	Examples: this was mainly created for the pasv_addr setting, so that
	people connecting locally could have a different pasv_addr than people
	connecting from the Internet, but it can be used with any settings:

	ifip 192.168.* 10.*
	  pasv_addr 10.10.10.1
	  sitename_long MyLanSite
	elseip
	  ifip 127.0.0.1
	    include /glftpd/etc/myspeciallocalsettings.conf
	  elseip
	    pasv_addr 128.1.2.3 1
	    sitename_long MyInternetSite
	  endifip
	endifip


ascii_downloads <size> [<mask1> <mask2> ...]
	<size> is the maximum byte size that can be downloaded in ASCII mode.
	Set it to 0 or any string (like 'disabled') to disable size check.

	<mask> is file masks which are allowed for ASCII mode. Files that
	don't match them have to be downloaded in BINARY mode. Omitting this
	setting is the same as using *, meaning all files will be downloadable.

	Exmp: ascii_downloads 20000 *.[Tt][Xx][Tt] *.[Dd][Ii][Zz]
	This will only allow downloading of .txt and .diz files that are 20
	thousand bytes or smaller in ASCII mode.

	Note: directory listings are not affected by this.


shutdown flag|-user|=group [flag|-user|=group ...]
	Shuts glftpd down for everyone EXCEPT the people specified on the right

	'shutdown 0' is the same as 'shutdown *'
	glftpd will display the /ftp-data/text/shutdown file to users that
	are denied login because of this setting.

	exmp: shutdown 1 =STAFF
	this will only allow users with flag 1 and members of group STAFF to
	log in

	exmp: shutdown !*
	this will not allow anyone to log in


free_space xxx
	This will prevent people from uploading if your free space on current drive is
	equal to or smaller than xxx megs.
	ex. Without this, if there is only 1 meg of free space and someone is uploading
	files 3 megs in size, all of them would fail the test and be deleted, resulting
	in a big waste of bandwidth.

use_dir_size k|b|m path1 [ path2 path3 ... ]
	This will make glftpd show directories' size (the total size of all
	files in that directory), instead of the number of bytes the directory
	itself takes up, when a user does a "LIST".

	k = kilobytes, b = bytes, m = megs

	*NOTE* For slow processors/hard drives, this might cause slow dir listing.

	path1 is mandatory - it should be the path for which this option will
	work. You may specify several paths. No wildcards. You don't even need
	full paths, instead of /site you can use /si and it will work for /site
	as well as every other directory starting with /si, and every
	subdirectory of that directory.

	exmp: use_dir_size k /
	This will show directory size, in kilobytes, for every directory on
	your site.

	exmp: use_dir_size m /site/incom /site/priva
	This will show directory size, in megabytes, for every directory that
	begins with "/site/incom" and "/site/priv", like /site/incoming,
	/site/incoming/whatever, /site/private, /site/privateer, etc.

timezone +-#
	This modifies the timezone + or - for different regions.
	eg: timezone -4 will show the time 4hours behind what it was showing originally

	NOTE: this command has been reported to slow down glftpd for some people - I have no
	idea why, it works fine for most.  Because of this, I decided not to bother fixing
	a bug that it has - new files/directories will have the system time, not the
	timezone-corrected time.

	It's best to use the 'localtime fix' instead of this setting - search the FAQ
	for how to do that.

color_mode 0|1
	This option determines whether colors are present in directory listing
	when a user has the color flag.

	Use "color_mode 0" to prevent glftpd from using color codes in directory
	listing. The control connection (the dialog between client and server)
	will show colors when the user has the color flag turned on.

	Use "color_mode 1" to make glftpd act like before, using colors both in
	the control connection and directory listing. This is the default
	action.

sitename_long <name>[:space:]<name>
	Your site's name.

sitename_short <abb>
	The abbreviation for your site.

login_prompt <string>
	String to replace the standard login prompt.

rootpath <path>
	The path where all your system directories reside. (bin, etc, lib...)

	Glftpd will chroot itself to this directory when a user connects, meaning
	nothing above this directory can be accessed through ftp. If no path is specified
	glftpd will assume /glftpd as its rootpath.

reload_config <path>
	The config file used when we recieve a SIGHUP signal.

	Glftpd will reload the config file when it recieves the SIGHUP signal. This
	will only happen if there is a reload_config line in the config file. The
	path specified is relative to the rootpath and to make this work the 
	file must be within the rootpath. 

	NOTE: When a bad config path is specified and glftpd gets a SIGHUP signal 
              the user will be logged out with an error telling its impossible to
	      read the config file.

master <user> [<user> ...]
	Here you can specify the master(s) of the site. The master(s) can change
	anyone's flags, including all siteops.

ipc_key #
	Glftpd uses shared memory, so it needs to use an ipc_key.  The default
	key that glftpd uses is "0x0000DEAD".  If you want to run another
	glftpd server, you need to define a different key for it in its own
	config file.  The key can be any 8-digit hexadecimal string, like:
	0x01234567, 0xDEADBABE, 0xBEEFBABE, 0xBADC0FEE, etc.

	If you're using ftpwho.c, it's ipc key will also need to be modified.

secure_ip <min num of fields> <nnhostname> <need ident?> <flags/=groups/-usernames>
	Glftpd will not allow users to add an IP address that doesn't pass these rules.

	<min num of fields> specifies the minimum number of fully numeric fields
	that need to be in the IP address.
	<nnhostname> can be 1 to allow hostnames (non-numeric IP addresses), or 0 to disallow them.
	<need ident?>, if set to 1, will require a valid ident for this IP.
	
	ex. secure_ip 2 1 0 =STAFF 1
	this will allow STAFF and siteops to add numeric IPs with 2 or more fully
        numeric fields, and it will let them add hostnames, as in a@b.com. A
	valid ident will not be required.

	ex. secure_ip 3 0 1 *
	this will allow everyone else to add IPs with 3 or more fully-numeric
	fields and it will not allow anyone to add hostnames. A valid ident
	will be required.

	You can have several secure_ip entries; glftpd will go through all of
	them. If a match for the user adding the IP is found in the flags,
	users and groups on the right, and the security settings allow the IP,
	the search will stop. Otherwise, glftpd will continue until either
	another rule allows the IP or there are no more rules. In the second
	case, if there were any rules that matched the user but denied the IP,
	the IP will be denied, otherwise it will be allowed.

secure_pass <mask> <flags/=groups/-usernames>
	Glftpd will not allow passwords that do not match <mask>.
	
	The mask's length sets the minimum password length.  You can also specify the
	minimum number of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, or "other symbols".

	The '.' is a placeholder to "fill in" to the minimum length you want.

	You can use any letter, number, or "other character" (remember, '.' has a
	special meaning) in this string.

	ex. "secure_pass Ab1... *" will only allow passwords 6 characters or longer
	that contain at least one capital letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.

	In this example, everyone who changes a password (through either "site passwd" or
	"site chpass" will have to stick to this mask.  If you replace '*' with flags,
	groups, etc, only users that match them will be forced to stick to this rule.
	
	You can have multiple secure_pass rules; if the first rule's
	permissions don't match the user, glftpd will go on to the next rule.
	If they do match, but the password does not meet the security
	requirement for that rule, glftpd will try other rules, until either a
	rule is found that matches the user and allows the password, or there
	are no more rules. In the second case, if there were any rules that
	matched the user but denied the password, the password will be denied,
	otherwise it will be allowed.

	ex. secure_pass ZZf3$. !1 !=STAFF *
	This will force everyone but siteops and members of STAFF to have passwords at
	least 6 characters long, with at least 2 upper case letters, one lower case letter,
	one digit, and one "other character".

datapath <path>
	The path where you keep all data-files (default ftp-data).
	This is relative to your rootpath.
	
	If your rootpath is /glftpd, this should be /ftp-data.
	If your rootpath is /, this should be /glftpd/ftp-data.

pwd_path <path/file>
	The path of where you want glftpd passwd file stored.
	(default is /etc/passwd, but for rootpath / set this to /glftpd/etc/passwd).

grp_path <path/file>
	The path of where you want your glftpd group file stored.
	(default is /etc/group)

botscript_path <path>
	The path to your bot script.

	The botscript will be executed after a directory is created, deleted,
	nuked or unnuked.
	You can use it to signal your bot to 'announce' the newest directory.

bouncer_ip XXXX [ XXXX ... ]
	..where XXXX is either an IPv4 address or a hostname.

	If you have (an) ftp bouncer(s), you have to put their IP(s) here so that glftpd
	knows when the connection is from a bouncer and when it's from a regular user.

	exmp:
	bouncer_ip 1.2.3.4 another.bouncer.dynamicip.net static.bouncer.com

speed_limit <path> <dl_limit> <up_limit> [flags/=groups/-usernames]
        Global bandwidth limit based on directory (first match is the one being used)
	The number is in bytes, so 50000 is 50 thousand bytes per second (almost 50K/s)

        The third argument is the familiar X (flag), -user or =group.
        If you have multiple speed_limit rules, first path/permission match decides
        which rule is active.

        exmp: speed_limit /site/Incoming* 150000 0
              speed_limit /site/Archives* 50000 0 1
              speed_limit /* 200000 0 =group -user
        (0 = unlimited)

sim_xfers max_downloads [max_uploads]
	Global setting controlling maximum simultaneous downloads and uploads
	on the whole site. -1 means unlimited.
	*NOTE* Users with the EXEMPT flag will not be affected, they can
	download even if this limit is reached.

	exmp: sim_xfers 10 -1
	This will only allow 10 downloads at a time. If a user tries to
	download something and there are already 10 other downloads in
	progress, he/she will receive an error message.

calc_crc [<filemask>|<path>] ...
	This is for on-the-fly CRC checking. It can take multiple arguments.

	You can use filemasks or paths or you can mix them.
	exmp: calc_crc *.rar /site/rars/games/* *.[Mm][Pp][3]
	This will calculate CRC for all rars, all files uploaded to the
	/site/rars/games directory (and its subdirectories), and all mp3s,
	including different cases (like .MP3 or .Mp3).  The CRC will be passed
	to zipscript as the third argument.  If you upload a file that does not
	match any mask listed and is not in any path listed, '000000' will be
	passed to zipscript.

xdupe filemask1 [filemask2 filemask3 ...]
	If the user turns x-dupe on, only files which match any of the filemasks
	will be reported.

	ex. filemask *.zip *.r?? *.gz *.tgz

	This will report zips, rars, gzips and gzipped tarballs on the x-dupe line.

mmap_amount <#>
	# can be a number from 1 to 50.  It represents the size (in MB's) of files being 
	downloaded to keep in memory (a little faster download).
        The default is 4 (files smaller than 4 megs are kept in memory during download)

	If you have little memory and big files, setting this to a low number may improve speed.

dl_sendfile <#>
	This option determains if we should use the zerocopy systemcall sendfile() on systems
	where this is available. This option overrules mmap_amount which is one of the 3
	possible downloading methods, being: plain, mmaped and zerocopy.
	If set to >0 this option is enabled, 0 or no line is disabled.
	The number specifies size ( in kbytes) of block for one sendfile() system call. During the call
        sharedmem (user info) is not updated, so for slower sites use smaller number !.

	If user has speed rate limit or transfer is using SSL glftpd will automatically fallback
	to mmap or normal upload.
	
	We strongly recommend you use this function unless you use a lot of speed limiting.

	As of v2.0RC5 this option is enabled by default unless specified otherwise (with 512kb blocks)

	NOTE: This system is not available on all operating systems, confirmed to support
	this are Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX. Also, this is only available on plain
	binary file transfers (no TLS/SSL).

ul_buffered <#>
	# can be a number from 0 to 50. It represents the size (in MB's) of the upload buffer
	where the data read from the network is buffered to decrese disk writes. This option
	should make uploads a little faster. 
	When set to 0 or when no line is present this option is disabled and the data will
	not be buffered.

min_homedir <path>
	You need this set to allow siteops to change users' home directories with "site change".
	ex. min_homedir /site will allow homedir to be inside the /site dir but not outside.

	NOTE: This setting has nothing to do with the actual users' homedirs,
	it is a simple security setting to stop siteops from allowing people to
	start in protected directories. To change actual homedirs, either edit
	/glftpd/etc/passwd for existing users, or modify the HOMEDIR line in
	/glftpd/ftp-data/users/default.* for new users. 

valid_ip <ip> [<ip> ...]
	If you have multiple IP's on your system, enter the ones you want glftpd to
	listen on.  Only connections to the listed IP(s) will be allowed, so if you add
	"valid_ip 127.0.0.1" to the config file, you will only be able to connect
	by typing "ftp 127.0.0.1 port" or "ftp localhost port", but not if you try
	"ftp 1.2.3.4 port".


active_addr <ip/hostname>
	Tells glftpd which interface to bind to when doing active file
	transfers. Without this, glftpd uses the same interface that the user
	connected to.

	If you have multiple active_addr lines, glftpd will cycle through them
	in a round-robin style each time the user transfers a file.


pasv_addr <ip> [1]
	Determines what IP/Host is used for passive mode.

	If you want glftpd to bind to this interface (for example, if you use
	more than one NIC in the same box and you want passive connections to
	not use the default one), just do "pasv_addr x.x.x.x".  If you want
	glftpd to only report this IP to the client but to bind to the default
	interface (as in when your box only has an internal IP and you're using
	NAT), do "pasv_addr x.x.x.x 1".

	If you have multiple pasv_addr lines, glftpd will cycle through them in
	a round-robin style each time a file is transferred using passive mode.


pasv_ports <X1[-Y1]> [<X2[-Y2]> ...]
	Causes glftpd to pick an open port between X and Y when making a
	passive connection, instead of picking a random port.

	If Y isn't present, glftpd will just use X. If Y is present, glftpd
	will pick a random port between X and Y. If there are too many
	errors trying to pick a port from the current range, glftpd will move
	on to the next one.

	Exmp: pasv_ports 10000-11000 20 21 22 23 80 110 1600-1610 35000-35050

	Maximum is 50 arguments. It makes most sense to use the biggest range
	as the first argument, since it'll be used most often.

	You should have at least 10 ports per user, so if you have 30 users
	online, this range should be 300, i.e. pasv_ports 2000-2300


active_ports <X1[-Y1]> [<X2[-Y2]> ...]                                                                                              
        Causes glftpd to pick an open port between X and Y when making a                                                            
        active connection, instead of picking a random port.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    
        If Y isn't present, glftpd will just use X. If Y is present,                                                                
        glftpd will pick a random port between X and Y. If there are too                                                            
        many errors trying to pick a port from the current range, glftpd                                                            
        will move on to the next one.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
        Maximum is 50 arguments. It makes most sense to use the biggest                                                             
        range as the first argument, since it'll be used most often.                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
        You should have at least 10 ports per user, so if you have 30                                                               
        users online, this range should be 300, i.e. active_ports                                                                   
        13000-13300                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
        This option together with pasv_ports will control which ports that                                                          
        will be used on the server by glftpd

allow_fxp <yes/no> <yes/no> <yes/no> [flag|-user|=group]
         downloads uploads  logging  permissions

	Defaults are: allow_fxp yes yes no *

	Fxp is an unofficial name for site-to-site transfers, where a user
	can directly upload from, or download to, another ftp server. This
	is done by "cheating" the ftp server, and using another server's
	IP and port in the PORT command.
	This setting can check whether the IP in the PORT command is the
	same as the IP the user connected from. If it isn't, that means the
	user is trying to establish a connection to another ftp server, and
	he will be denied if he doesn't match permissions. This will also
	check whether an incoming data connection, when using the PASV command,
	is from the user or not (this is another way to cheat).

	The third setting, if set to yes, will log all attempted transfers
	(whether successful or not) to foreign addresses to sysop.log for
	users that match permissions.

	Permissions are the familiar X (flag), -user or =group.
	If you have multiple allow_fxp rules, first permission match decides
	which rule is active.

	Exmp: allow_fxp no yes no =Leech 8
	This will allow people in group Leech or anonymous users to upload from
	foreign addresses (like other ftp sites), but will not allow them to
	download to foreign addresses. All other users are allowed both.

	Exmp: allow_fxp yes yes yes *
	This will allow everyone to do site-to-site transfers, but it will log
	each of them to login.log

	Exmp: allow_fxp yes yes no =STAFF
	      allow_fxp no yes no *
	This will allow users in group STAFF to both download and upload using
	fxp, and it will deny downloads for everyone else.


welcome_msg <path/filename> <flags/groups/users>
	A file displayed at login, after the user has entered his password.

	If you have multiple lines, glftpd will try to match the user with
	flags/groups/usernames on the right.
	The first match will display the file (first argument) and stop the search.

goodbye_msg <path/filename> <flags/groups/users>
	Displayed at logoff.

	Same as above.

newsfile <path/filename> <flags/groups/users>
	Displayed after the first cd-command you issue.

	Same as above, but glftpd will NOT stop on the first match - all matches will
	be displayed.

banner <path/filename>
	Displayed before the prompt for username.

alias <alias> <directory>
	Defines an alias for a directory.

	ex. alias	util	/incoming/utils

	This would allow a user to issue the command 'cd util' anywhere, and it
	would take him to 'homedir/incoming/utils' where homedir is his home
	directory like /site (in which case it'd be /site/incoming/utils).

cdpath <cdpath>
	Defines a search-path when changing directories.

	ex. cdpath	/incoming/utils
	    cdpath	/incoming/games

	If a user tries to cd to the directory 'foo' it will be searched for in the
	following order:

	./foo
	an alias called 'foo'
	homedir/incoming/utils/foo
	homedir/incoming/games/foo

	... where homedir is the user's home directory (/site by default)

	This only works with the cd command.

ignore_type <filemask> [<filemask> ...]
	Will ignore the assigned file types from being recognized in the directory race info, 
	nukes, unnukes, and dupes.	
	
	Example:
	ignore_type  *.[tT][xX][tT] *.[nN][fF][oO] [rR][eE][aA][dD][mM][eE] .message
	ignore_type  *.[sS][fF][vV] *.[cC][rR][cC] *.[dD][iI][zZ]

*** NOTE: These are examples only..they do not necessarily reflect the tree you need to use.
*** NOTE: The ???? is used to match date directories, like 1214

See the file glftpd.conf-EXAMPLES for more examples

This rights section is read from top to bottom.
The first directory match will stop the search, so you should put the more
specific directories on top and the least specific ones on the bottom.
NOTE: As of glftpd 1.24, the rights section is case-sensitive.

Special variables:
If the paths in the settings above contain "[:username:]" or "[:groupname:]",
glftpd will replace them with username or primary group's name, respectively,
when it's checking those rules.

Exmp:   upload /home/[:username:]/* *
        This will allow only joe to upload in /home/joe.

*END RIGHTS SECTION*

stat_section <keyword> <directory> <separate credits>
	Here you can define up to 10 multiple statistic sections.

			Keyword		Directory		Separate Creds
			-------		---------		--------------
	stat_section	DEFAULT		*			yes


	THIS SECTION MUST ALWAYS BE ADDED IN THE CONFIG FILE AS THE FIRST SECTION!!

	If you want to define more statistic sections simply add another
	line. The directory option uses the same wildcard scheme as
	delete, upload etc.

	ex.

	stat_section	GAMES		/site/incoming/games/*	yes
	stat_section	UTILS		/site/incoming/utils/*	no

	This would make 2 new sections, 1 Games and 1 Utils. The games
	section is using a separate credit system which means that
	all uploads/downloads/credits will change as soon as a user changes
	to the games directory. If he goes into the utils directory
	uploads/downloads will change but the credits will remain the same
	as in the default section.

	If you want to create one section from multiple paths, use the special
	keyword [:and:] to separate the paths, like:
	stat_section LINUX /slackware[:and:]/debian[:and:]/redhat yes

	site USERS, site GIVE, site TAKE, site GINFO, ALL STATS, all show or
	change data from current section only (based on which directory you
	are in).

	All stat commands that display text files with cookies in them
	(wkup, gpal, etc) look for SECTIONfilename if you are invoking them
	for a section other than DEFAULT.

	*NOTE* The maximum number of sections specified is 10!! You can not add
               more. This includes the default section.


path-filter <group> <path/filename> [<filter> ...]
	Sets rules for what characters a filename can have.

	 		Group	Message-file		Filters
			-----	------------		-------
	path-filter	*	/ftp-data/misc/pathmsg	^[-A-Za-z0-9_.()[:space:]]*$  ^\.  ^-

	This line means that a filename may only be made up of the characters 
	A-Z, a-z,0-9, "._-()" and spaces, and that it may not start with "." or "-".
	
	The filters are regular expressions - type `man re_exec` to learn more
	about these rules. (For complete syntax, you might need to figure out
	the right page, on debian it's 'man 7 regex').

	If you want characters '[' and ']' in filenames, use this path-filter:
	path-filter     *       /ftp-data/misc/pathmsg  ^[][A-Za-z0-9_.'()[:space:]-]*$  ^\.  ^-
	
	If a filename is invalid the message-file will be displayed.

	If you supply a group-name instead of '*' the rule will only apply to
	users who belong to that group.

	You can use multiple path-filter lines. The first match wins, so the
	line with * in the group field should always be last.

	You can disable path-filter by commenting it out, but this is a security
	risk and it is not recommended. Just add the characters you need to
	the list and leave it on.

max_users <#> <#>
	The maximum amount of users allowed to login at once.

	The first number specifies the maximum amount of users allowed to connect to the site.
	The second number specifies how many exempt users can connect, if the site is already full.
	They must have exempt flag for this to work. Exempt users take up a slot, just like everyone else,
	so if you have max_users 5 5, and you have 5 exempt users logged in, non-exempt users won't be able to login.

	*** NOTE: You cannot do this with people connected to the site; if you change this
		    you MUST have 0 users connect and no gl_spy running, otherwise you will
		    get a 220 Server Error: (SHMGET) Failed! error.
		    Look in the FAQ for a fix to this.

max_ustats <#> [flag|-user|=group]
	The maximum amount of results shown when the matching users use the user stats commands.
	These commands include all, month, week and day up and download tops.

	The first number specified the maximum number of results shown for the people that match
	the flags/users/groups. If -1 is specified as the number the result is unlimited.

	Please note that the first match always wins. Thus if you would like everyone with flag 1
	to be able to see the complete top but other only the first 10 you would need:
		max_ustats -1 1
		max_ustats 10 *

max_gstats <#> [flag|-user|=group]
	The maximum amount of results shown when the matching users use the group stats commands.
	These commands include all, month, week and day up and download tops.

	The first number specified the maximum number of results shown for the people that match
	the flags/users/groups. If -1 is specified as the number the result is unlimited.

	Please note that the first match always wins. Thus if you would like everyone with flag 1
	to be able to see the complete top but other only the first 10 you would need:
		max_gstats -1 1
		max_gstats 10 *

banned_users <user> [<user> ...]
	To ban users (prevent accounts with their usernames from being created)

	ex. banned_users root billgates

	If present, file "/rootpath/ftp-data/help/site.adduser.banned" will be
        displayed when someone attempts to add root or billgates.

show_diz <filename> [rights]
	A filename that will be shown, if it exists, when you change into a directory.
	You can have multiple lines and they can be bound to rights.

	ex. show_diz	FILE_ID.DIZ  1
	    show_diz	.message
	This would show the print out the files FILE_ID.DIZ just for siteops 
	and .message for everyone when you change into any directory in which they exist.

	Cookies present in this file will not be interpreted by glftpd (think
	security).

show_totals <max lines> <path> [<path> ...]
	When a user cd's into a directory that matches <path>, the totals for this
	directory (race info) will be calculated and displayed, showing max <max lines>
        results.

	You can have multiple lines with multiple arguments each.

	ex. show_totals 30 /site/incoming/????/*/
	This will show statistics for all directories in /incoming/0301, but
	not for their subdirectories (remove the trailing / if you want that)

dl_incomplete <1/0>
	Whether or not to allow users to download a file before it is completely
	uploaded.

	It is best to have this set to 1; if a file is still being uploaded and
	a user tries to download it, glftpd will not close the transfer until
	the file is finished, so you won't download incomplete files if you
	download faster than the uploader is uploading. This setting causes the
	file that's being uploaded to have 755 permissions; if it is set to 0,
	the file will be 600.
	NOTE: this only works if the upload is steady; if there are long
	periods of inactivity during upload (over 30 seconds), glftpd stops
	waiting and closes the transfer. It does this by checking the file's
	modification time, so older files with 755 permissions will be sent
	without waiting.

file_dl_count <1/0>
	1 is the default - glftpd changes each file's GID by +1 when that file
	is downloaded (up to 99 times). This number is displayed when you do
	long listing (list -l) and your color is on (so it's safe to assume
	you're in UNIX; Windows clients choke on listing like that).

	Setting this to 0 turns it off, so GID will not be incremented, and
	listing will not display the number of times each file was downloaded.
	
dupe_check <#> [yes/no]
	The amount of days back to check for dupes.

	Set this to 0 to disable dupe-checking.

	The second parameter is optional - "no" is assumed if it's missing.
	It refers to ignoring file case when checking dupes. If you set it to
	yes, it will act like Windows, so file.zip will be treated the same as
	FILE.zip and glftpd will say it's a dupe.

	logs/dupefile is automatically "compressed" and glftpd will randomly
	(1/1000) decide to remove all entries older than your days limit.

3 built-in scripts:
	The paths to these scripts must be full. If your rootpath is "/", these
	paths have to be /glftpd/bin/scriptname (unless you move them to /bin). 

	For pre_check and pre_dir_check, you should only echo normal text if
	the exit code that follows it will be > 0 (meaning the file/directory
	will be rejected). If you want to echo something and then exit with 0,
	you have to put "#0" at the beginning of the echo string.
        Exmp: echo "#0File will be accepted!"

pre_check /bin/dupescript [path mask]
	pre_check runs BEFORE an upload begins

	For path mask description, see post_check below.
	See example dupescript in /glftpd/bin

pre_dir_check /bin/dirscript [path mask]
	pre_dir_check runs BEFORE a directory is created

	For path mask description, see post_check below.
	See example dirscript in /glftpd/bin

post_check /bin/zipscript [path mask]
	post_check runs AFTER an upload finishes

	post_check can be defined multiple times. Path mask is optional; if
	present, glftpd will only execute this script if the path mask matches
	the full path to where the file was uploaded. If the path doesn't
	match, glftpd will try to find another post_check declaration whose
	path does match, or one that doesn't have a path mask.

	Example:
	post_check none /site/public/*  # disables zipscript in /site/public
	post_check /bin/special.sh /site/special/*      # special zipscript
	post_check /bin/zipscript *     # normal zipscript for all other paths

	If you want to enable upload resume in a certain path, you should
	disable the zipscript for that path, so that partial files are not
	deleted when the uploader loses connection.

	The post_check script receives 3 parameters from glftpd:
	$1 - the name of file uploaded
	$2 - the directory the file was uploaded to
	$3 - the CRC code of that file (if calc_crc was enabled, or 000000 otherwise)
	     NOTE: If the uploader times out the CRC code will also be 000000, this to
	           prevent that if one reconnected and started uploading the same file
	           again but left an stalled upload session alive a bad crc would be passed,
	           and the file would get deleted.

	If zipscript exits with 1 or 127, glftpd assumes there was a problem executing
	it. The file will not be deleted or unduped.
	If zipscript exits with anything bigger than 1, glftpd will assume that the
	file uploaded was bad and it will be deleted, the user's credits and stats will
	not be added, and the file will be removed from the dupe database.

	If zipscript exits with a number between 10 and 1010, glftpd will "sleep" for that
	many seconds minus 10 before continuing.  This might be helpful if you want to
	prevent people from uploading a file that is being uploaded to their system over
	and over until it is complete.
	ex. To make a user wait 10 seconds after uploading a bad file, exit with 20.
	NOTE: exit code 127 is exempted: it will NOT cause a delay, it will be
	treated like exit code 1 instead.

idle_commands command1 [command2 command3 ...]
	This sets what commands to ignore when resetting the idle counter.

	ex. idle_commands noop pwd cwd* site[:space:]who
	This will not reset the idle counter when a user issues noop, pwd, cwd
	(alone or followed by other characters/arguments), or "site who", so
	users who use these commands and not any others will be disconnected
	after their idle timeout expires.

	NOTE: The "idle time" that you see in site who, gl_spy, etc, is NOT
        the same timer used to disconnect people, it is time idle since the
        last command issued by the user. The "real" idle timer is internal and
        cannot be seen (not that there is any reason to see it).

	NOTE: The STOR, APPE and RETR commands can't be used as idle commands
        because the timer *has to* be refreshed during transfer, otherwise
        people would drop out downloading big files.

total_users <#>
	This sets a limit of how many users that can be added.

lslong <path/file options> [<num of asterisks>]
	This sets the default 'ls' command parameters.
	
	ex. lslong -a
	This will make glftpd show hidden files by default

	The second argument is optional; it specifies the number of asterisks
	that glftpd will allow in arguments to LIST. The default is 2. If you
	want unlimited, use 0. exmp: ls /*/* will work by default, but
	ls /*/*/* will not - this is to prevent abuse of the globbing function
	that could raise load average on the box to very high levels.


hidden_files <path> <filemask> [<filemask> ...]
	Specifies masks for files, directories, links, etc that will be
	skipped during directory listing, even if the -a switch is used to show
	standard hidden files (starting with .)

	Exmp: hidden_files / .message hidden.*


noretrieve <filename> [<filename> ...]
	Specifies files that cannot be downloaded.

	Password files and other sensitive files should be listed here.


dir_names <1/0> [<lower/upper>] [XY] [XY] ...
	Rules for new directory names.

			Caps	Upper or Lower	Character Conversions
			----	--------------	---------------------
	dir_names	1	lower		[:space:]_ ,. [( ])

	This will change the case of every character in new directories to lower
	case, capitalize the first character, convert all spaces to underscores,
	all commas to periods, and all brackets to parentheses.

	If you don't want the second option active, just use any word other than
	lower or upper, i.e. dir_names 1 blah [conversions...]

	If the second of the character pairs in the third option is the word NULL,
	the first character will simply be deleted. exmp:
	dir_names 1 nothing ,NULL 'NULL [( ]) [:space:]_
	this will delete commas and apostrophes

file_names <1/0> [<lower/upper>] [XY] [XY] ...
	Rules for new file names.

	See dir_names as the same rules apply.

tagline <string>
	If a user's tagline matches string, he will be forced to change it
	before glftpd lets him download.

email <user@host.tld>
	Admin's e-mail (used with the e-mail cookie).

multiplier_max <#>
	The highest multiplier a nuker can use.


oneliners <#> 
	This tells the number of oneliners to show on the site onel command.
	If this is set to 0 or this line does not exist glftpd will consider the
	oneliners to be disabled.

requests <path/filename> <#>
	
			Location			# of lines to store
			--------			-------------------
	requests	/ftp-data/misc/requests		10
	

	Tells glftpd where to look for the request display
	file and how many lines to store.

lastonline <0/1/2> [#]

	This setting determains if we should log certain cases.  
	If it is 0, all users will be logged.
	If it is 1, users who timed out and who didn't upload,
	download, nuke or add users will not be logged.  If it is 2,
	users who quit, timed out, or lost connection (and who didn't upload,
	download, nuke, or add users) will not be logged.
	The second options is the default number of lines to show when 
	someone does site laston. If none specified the default is 10.
	exmp:
	lastonline 0 10

	NOTE: If there is no lastonline line in the config we will nog log 
	      the lastonline at all.

empty_nuke <#>
	The amount of kbytes that will be removed from the user if
	his empty directory is nuked.

nodupecheck <path>
	This suspends both the internal dupe check (done by searching
	ftp-data/logs/dupefile) and the execution of pre_check (also called
	dupescript) for files uploaded under <path>.

	This uses the same default wildcard-scheme.

creditcheck <path> <ratio> [<-user|=group|flag> ...]
	Set other ratio than default on a directory.

	If the user doesn't match the permissions on the right, glftpd will
	move on to the next rule. Path is only checked if the permissions for
	this rule apply. If you don't have any permissions, * is assumed, so
	the rule applies to everyone.

	This ratio is only used for uploading, people get file size * ratio
	credits when they upload. This isn't used for downloading, so setting
	this to 0 does not allow people to download for free. Use the 
	"creditloss" option for that.

	The path uses the same default wildcard-scheme.

creditloss <multiplier> <allow leechers yes/no> <path> <permissions>
	Sets the amount of credits lost in <path>.

	If multiplier is 0, users downloading files that match <path> will not
        lose any credits. If it's >1, users that match this rule will lose that
	number * filesize of credits for each file they download from <path>.

	If second argument is "no" and the user's active ratio (either main
	ratio if sratio for the current section is -1, or sratio) is 0, the
	user will be denied downloads that match <path>. The error given will
	be the same as if user had no 'download' right in glftpd.conf.

	<path> can be either /path/to/filename, or /path/*. The second is
	recursive (obviously) and matches all files in that path.

	<permissions> are the same -user =group flag used in many other
	settings.

	You can have multiple creditloss statements - first path match wins.

	Exmp: creditloss 0 yes /site/freestuff/* *
	This will allow everyone to download for free from /site/freestuff

	Exmp: creditloss 2 yes /site/heavystuff/* =somegroup
	This will charge members of somegroup twice the amount of credits
	they would lose for downloading files from /site/heavystuff without
	this rule.

	Exmp: creditloss 3 no /site/specialfile.zip *
	This will cause file /site/specialfile.zip to cost 3 * filesize of
	credits to people downloading it, and users with leech (ratio=0) will
	not be allowed to download it at all.

nukedir_style <format> <0/1/2> <byte>
	Settings for site NUKE command.

	2nd option: 0 = delete all nuked directories
		    1 = delete files, keep directories
		    2 = keep files and directories

	nukedir_style	NUKED-%N	2	50000	

	This would cause a nuked dir to be renamed to NUKED-Dirname.
	It would also save all files inside - so if you unnuke the directory,
	you get all files back.

	If the size of all files in the dir is below 50000 (third option), the 
	dir will be treated as empty and nuked with the empty dir penalty.

hideuser <-user/=group/flag> ...
	Allows you to hide users from being displayed in site who, added to
	the last-users-online file, or listed with "site users".

	exmp: hideuser -Usurper =HIDDENGROUP 1 7 =LEECH

	This will hide all users with siteop and useredit flags, all users
	belong to groups HIDDENGROUP or LEECH, and user Usurper.

	*NOTE* This setting does not affect siteops - they can see all.

	If you want to hide users from stat commands, you need to chown
	their userfiles to 99:99.

privgroup <group> <description>
	Here you define your private groups.

	ex. privgroup STAFF Siteops[:space:]And[:space:]Such

msgpath <path> <filename> <flag/=group/-user>
	Display a file when a user goes into the specified directory.

	*NOTE* You NEED a trailing slash at the end of path if you don't have a wildcard there.

	exmp: msgpath /site/incoming/ /ftp-data/misc/incoming.txt *
	      msgpath /site/incoming/????/* /ftp-data/misc/dir_and_subdirs.txt *
	      msgpath /site/incoming/????/*/ /ftp-data/misc/somedirs.txt *

	NOTE: On the right, you need to specify which users this rule applies to.

privpath <path> <flag/-user/=group>
	Here you define who will get access to certain directories.
	
	Users that do not match any flags/groups/usernames will not see the directory.

	*NOTE* You can't use wildcards in the path here.  Wildcards would slow down
	directory listing too much.

site_cmd <cmd name> <exec/text/is> <filename> [optional argument]
	Here you can define external site commands.

	EXEC will execute a script/binary.
	TEXT will display a text file, converting cookies to their values.
	IS will execute the internal command specified afterwards.

	site_cmd	UPURGE	EXEC	/bin/upurge.sh
	site_cmd	RULES	TEXT	/ftp-data/misc/site.rules
	site_cmd	PICTURE TEXT	/ftp-data/misc/picture.asc
	site_cmd	WEEKTOP	IS	WKUP

	*NOTE* All custom commands need the access rights defined for them
	in order to work.  Exmp:
	custom-rules *
	custom-picture =STAFF -Usurper 1 7
	custom-weektop !8 *

	After defining here, you can use these as in "site rules" or "site
	upurge".
	Be aware that commands defined with the IS setting (like WEEKTOP above)
	are subject to 2 sets of restrictions: first, the custom-weektop
	setting, and then the -stats setting (which controls WKUP).

	If using the EXEC mode, you can specify an optional argument that will
	be passed to the program in front of any user arguments. To specify
	multiple arguments, use [:space:]. Example:

	site_cmd	TEST	EXEC	/bin/test.sh	arg1[:space:]arg2
	custom-test *

	Now when someone issues "site test moo", test.sh will be executed with
	3 arguments: test.sh bleh blah moo.

max_sitecmd_lines #
	Specifies the maximum number of output lines from a custom site
	command that are shown to users. Default is 9999.

cscript <cmd name> <when to run> <path/filename>
	CScript is short for Custom Script.
	Custom scripts (or binaries) to be executed before/after any command.
	<cmd name> - the name of the command before/after which to execute the script.
	<when to run> - can be either "pre" or "post", to run before or after, respectively.
	<path/filename> - the full path to the script to be executed.

	If using a command with a space in it, like a site command, you need
        to use "[:space:]" between the words, ex: site[:space:]who.

        "post" scripts won't be able to echo anything because they are executed
        after glftpd sends the response to the client - can't do this any other
        way.
	If a "pre" script exits with anything bigger than 0 (or if it can't be executed),
	glftpd will NOT execute the command which should run after the script, nor will
	it execute that command's "post" script.

	Some "post" scripts will not be executed when the command they follow
	fails (for example, if you try to add a user, but have no access to the
	'site adduser' command). Here is the list of commands that behave
	this way:
	DELE, RMD, STOR, APPE, STOU, RETR, CWD, CDUP, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, PASV, TYPE;
	and SITE commands: CHANGE, ADDUSER, GADDUSER, DELUSER, NUKE, UNNUKE,
	WIPE, KILL, KICK, REQUEST, REQFILLED, ONEL.
        This list might grow in the future.

	It is YOUR responsibility to echo the correct MESSAGE CODE with every echo line
	that you use - if you echo the wrong code, ftp clients may 'hang'.  To find out
	what code you need to use, just look at what glftpd uses when that command is executed.
        Example: if you run a script before "site who", and you want to print
        something from it, use: echo -e "200Your message here\r".

        If you exit a pre script with 1 in order to prevent the user from
        executing the command, you might want to use a generic error code with
        your echo lines, like 500, which will tell the clients that this
        command was denied - or use the error code that glftpd uses when
        denying execution of this command.

        Both kinds of scripts will be passed 3 parameters:
        $1 = full command string the user used, $2 = user's login name,
        $3 = user's primary non-private group.

	ex:
	cscript site[:space:]who pre /bin/sitewhoprescript.sh
	cscript retr post /bin/postdownloadscript.sh

	NOTE: There is no limit to how many cscript entries you can have.
	


The following environment variables can be used by external scripts:

	$USER		Username.
	$FLAGS		User flags.
	$TAGLINE	User tagline.
	$GROUP		User group.
	$RATIO		User ratio.
	$PGROUP		1st priv group.
	$SPEED		Speed in K/s. This is exported after every upload/download.
	$HOST		User's ident@ip
	$HOME		User's home directory (from /glftpd/etc/passwd)
	$SECTION	The name of the section user is currently in


.------------------------------------.
|   Who can use what site commands?  |
`------------------------------------'

Below is a list of configurable site commands.
To the right of a command are flags - a user needs at least one of those
to be able to execute the command.  You can also use groupname instead of
a flag (the format is =groupname) or username (format is -username).
'*' means "everyone".  A ! in front of a flag/group/username means no access
if user matches this right - the scan through parameters will stop at this
point (so first match, whether positive or negative, ends the search. No
match is treated like a negative match - no access).

Note: by default, gadmins have access to the following commands:
	-addip, -adduser, -changeratio, -chpass, -delip, -deluser,
	-flags, -ginfo, -grpnfo, -readd, -userextra.
	These commands are gadmin-restricted, meaning that if you are a
	gadmin you can only use those commands on users who are in the 
	same group as your first (primary) group.  Other commands are
	not gadmin-restricted, so if you give gadmins access to them, they
	will be able to use them on ANY user.

	The "site purge" command is also gadmin-restricted, but gadmins don't
	have access to it by default. Showing user comments when doing
	"site user", controlled by -usercomment, is also restricted but not
	enabled by default.

You can define your own "You do not have access to this command" for each
of the settings above.
First, create directory "ad" in /glftpd/ftp-data/misc. Then, create a file in
that directory with the same name as the restriction keyword shown above,
without the leading dash, and put whatever text you want displayed in it.
(so, if you want glftpd to say "You do not have access to see who is online"
when a user does "site who" and he/she doesn't have access to it, create a file
called "who").
Glftpd will try to display the individual file first; if that doesn't work,
it will show the generic no access error.

# Custom commands must also be bound to flags, just add "custom-"
# in front of the custom command's name

custom-rules    *







.------------------------------------.
|III. Complete list of site commands.|
`------------------------------------'





*** NOTE: In glftpd 1.17 and newer, access to site commands is defined in the config file (at the bottom), it is no longer hard-coded in glftpd.

USAGE: site adduser <user> <password> [<ident@ip#1> ... <ident@ip#5>]
	Adds a user. You can have wild cards for users that have dynamic ips
	Examples: *@192.168.1.* , frank@192.168.*.* , bob@192.*.*.*
	(*@192.168.1.1[5-9] will allow only 192.168.1.15-19 to connect but no one else)

	If a user is added by a groupadmin, that user will have the GLOCK
	flag enabled and will inherit the home directory from the default.user
	or default.<groupname> file.
	
	All default values for the user are read from file default.user in
	/glftpd/ftp-data/users. Comments inside describe what is what.
	Gadmins can be assigned their own default.<group> userfiles
	as templates to be used when they add a user, if one is not found,
	default.user will be used.
	default.groupname files will also be used for "site gadduser".

	ex. site ADDUSER Archimede mypassword 

	This would add the user 'Archimede' with the password 'mypassword'.

	ex. site ADDUSER Archimede mypassword *@127.0.0.1
	
	This would do the same as above + add the ip '*@127.0.0.1' at the
	same time.

	HOMEDIRS:
	After login, the user will automatically be transferred into his/her
	homedir. As of 1.16.x this dir is now "kinda" chroot'ed and they are
	now unable to "cd ..".


USAGE: site addip <user> <ident@ip#1 ... ident@ip#10>
	Add IP to user.

	Note: if you don't know what ident is, you need to read your
	internet-for-dummies book first.

	ex. site addip Archimede Archimede@127.0.0.1 *@10.10.
	This would add the ident@ip 'Archimede@127.0.0.1' and mask '*@10.10.*'
	to user 'Archimede'. (* at the end is optional in this case)

	ex. site addip Archimede Archimede@blah.net Archimede@209.44.* *@24.1.64.20
	This would add all 3 ip masks to user 'Archimede'.

	ex. site addip lamer someident@3.1.2.1[2-5]?
	This mask will match IPs 3.1.2.120 through 3.1.2.159
	Warning: You can't use [] to declare range of numbers > 9, so [10-79]
	will not work. Use [1-7]? or [1-7][0-9] instead. Ranges that don't start
	at a power of 10 or don't end at 9 are not possible unless you add
	more than 1 mask.

	NOTE: There is a maximum of 10 IPs that can go into the userfile.
	If you need more than 10, you need to add them to a text file, each one
	on a line by itself, in the format ident@ip.  To make glftpd use this
	file, the first IP in the userfile (IP0 in site user) has to look like
	this:
	IP !/path/to/iplist.txt
	Glftpd won't let you add an IP like that; you need to edit the userfile
	manually (in /glftpd/ftp-data/users) and add it.
	Make sure there are no DOS carriage returns at the end of each line in
	the file containing the list of IPs.
	If an entry in that file starts with !, it will be banned (meaning if
	the user connects from that ident@ip, he will NOT be allowed to log in,
	even if there is a different IP below that would let him in).

	The file can contain comments following each IP. Separate the comment
	from the IP with spaces/tabs followed by the # character. Exmp:
	!1.2.3.4	#this user is not allowed to connect from this ip
	2.3.4. 		#user's home ip mask (same as 2.3.4.*)


USAGE: site aldn [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display alltime downloaders.

	Number is optional - it controls the number of output lines.

	Section is optional. It can be either a section's name or number (0-9).
	If section is numeric, you need to preceed it by the number of output
	lines, e.g.:
	site aldn 10 2

	This is the same for all statistic commands (wkup,gpal,nuketop,etc)

	<=group> is also optional. Specifying it will only show users who
	belong to that group, but the user doing it has to have special
	access in glftpd.conf to do it. This is controlled by the -grpstats
	setting.

	Exmp: -grpstats *
	site aldn =Friends
	site aldn 20 LinuxSection =Leechers

USAGE: site alup [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display alltime uploaders.

USAGE: site dayup [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display daytop upload.

USAGE: site daydn [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display daytop download.

USAGE: site monthup [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display monthtop upload.

USAGE: site monthdn [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display monthtop download.

USAGE: site nuketop [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display alltime nuketop.

USAGE: site wkup [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display weektop uploaders.

USAGE: site wkdn [number] [<section>] [<=group>]
	Display weektop downloaders.


USAGE: site alias
	Show current aliases.

USAGE: site cdpath
	Show current cdpaths.

USAGE: site chpass <user> <password> 
	Change users password.

	ex. site chpass Archimede newpassword
	This would change the password to 'newpassword' for the 
	user 'Archimede'.

	See "site passwd" for more info if you get a "Password is not secure
	enough" error.

	* Denotes any password, ex. site chpass arch *
	This will allow arch to login with any password

	@ Denotes any email-like password, ex. site chpass arch @
	This will allow arch to login with a@b.com but not ab.com

USAGE: chgadmin <user> <group>
	Toggle the users gadmin status for the given group.

	NOTE: When a user becomes a gadmin he will automaticly get
              flag 2 added. When a user stops to become a gadmin of 
              any of his groups the gadmin flag will be automaticly
	      removed.

USAGE: site change <user> <field> <value> - change a field for a user
       site change =<group> <field> <value> - change a field for each member of group <group>

			Syntax: site change user wkly_allotment "#,###"
			The first number is the section number (0=default section),
			the second is the number of kilobytes to give.
			(user's credits are replaced, not added to, with this value)
			Only one section at a time is supported,
	homedir		This will change the user's homedir.

			"min_homedir /site" to your config file, where "/site" is the
			minimum directory that users can have, i.e. you can't change
			a user's home directory to /ftp-data or anything that doesn't
			have "/site" at the beginning.
			Important: don't use a trailing slash for homedir!
			Users CAN NOT cd, list, upload/download, etc, outside of their
                        home dir. It acts similarly to chroot() (try man chroot).
	startup_dir	The directory to start in. ex: /incoming will start the user

			Users CAN cd, list, upload/download, etc, outside of startup_dir.
	idle_time	Sets the default and maximum idle time for this user (overrides
			the -t and -T settings on glftpd command line). If -1, it is disabled;
			if 0, it is the same as the idler flag.
	expires		yyyy-mm-dd : The date a user expires, after this date a user will no
			longer be able to login. To never let a user expire use "never" instead
			of yyyy-mm-dd.

	num_logins	# # : number of simultaneous logins allowed. The second
			number is number of sim. logins from the same IP.
	timeframe	# # : the hour from which to allow logins and the hour when logins from
        		this user will start being rejected. This is set in a 24 hour format.
			If a user is online past his timeframe, he'll be disconnected the
			next time he does a 'CWD'.
	time_limit	Time limits, per LOGIN SESSION. (set in minutes. 0 = Unlimited)
	tagline		User's tagline.
	comment		Changes the user's comment (max 50 characters).
			Comments are displayed by the comment cookie (see below).
	max_dlspeed	Downstream bandwidth control (KBytes/sec) (0 = Unlimited)

				(doesn't work for private groups).
	GLOCK		3	User cannot change group.
	EXEMPT		4	Allows to log in when site is full. Also allows

	Restrictions placed on users flagged ANONYMOUS.
		1.  '!' on login is ignored.
		2.  They cannot DELETE, RMDIR, or RENAME. 
		3.  Userfiles do not update like usual, meaning no stats will
	    	    be kept for these users.  The userfile only serves as a template for the starting

	If -max is not specified, glftpd defaults to 20 matches.
	Matches are taken from the bottom of the dupelog (newest entries are
        at the bottom).

	If you specify more than one search string, glftpd will only show

	without having to know his password and logging in as that user. Most
	siteops will find no use for this.

	things. Some things won't work, and some will work incorrectly. The

        Display total uploads/downloads by all existing users in all sections.


USAGE: site unnuke <directory> <message>
	Unnuke a directory.

	ex. site unnuke shit NOT CRAP
	
	This will unnuke the directory 'shit' with the comment 'NOT CRAP'.

        NOTE: You can enclose the directory in braces if you have spaces in the name
        ex. site unnuke {My directory name} justcause

	You need to configure glftpd to keep nuked files if you want to unnuke.
	See the section about glftpd.conf.


USAGE: site undupe <string>
	Remove filename(s) from ftp-data/logs/dupefile

	ex. site undupe cls*

	This will remove all files that start with the string 'cls' from
	the dupe database.


USAGE: site predupe <filename>
	Adds <filename> to the dupefile database, so that it can't be uploaded.

	Users need access to -predupe in glftpd.conf to use this.

	Files that match those listed under ignore_type in glftpd.conf will
	not be added.


USAGE: site vers
	Show current glftpd version.


USAGE: site who
	Display users currently online.


USAGE: site welcome
	Display the welcome screen.

USAGE: site wipe [-r] <file/directory>

	This is similar to the UNIX rm command.
	In glftpd, if you just delete a file, the uploader loses credits and
	upload stats for it.  There are many people who didn't like that and
	were unable/too lazy to write a shell script to do it for them, so I
	wrote this command to get them off my back.

        If the argument is a file, it will simply be deleted. If it's a
	directory, it and the files it contains will be deleted.  If the
	directory contains other directories, the deletion will be aborted.

	To remove a directory containing subdirectories, you need to use
	"site wipe -r dirname". BE CAREFUL WHO YOU GIVE ACCESS TO THIS COMMAND.
	Glftpd will check if the parent directory of the file/directory you're
	trying to delete is writable by its owner. If not, wipe will not
	execute, so to protect directories from being wiped, make their parent
	555.

	Also, wipe will only work where you have the right to delete (in
	glftpd.conf). Delete right and parent directory's mode of 755/777/etc
	will cause glftpd to SWITCH TO ROOT UID and wipe the file/directory.
	"site wipe -r /" will not work, but "site wipe -r /incoming" WILL, SO
	BE CAREFUL.

	This command will remove the deleted files/directories from the dirlog
	and dupefile databases.
	
	To give access to this command, add "-wipe -user flag =group" to the
	config file (similar to other site commands).


*NOTE*	The two commands below require unzip to reside in the /bin directory
	(it's /bin in the chroot'ed environment, so /glftpd/bin in reality) 


USAGE: site xdupe [mode]

	If mode is present, xdupe mode will be set to it. If not, glftpd will
	print currently set mode.

	Xdupe will allow clients that keep queues of files to be uploaded to
	quickly remove files from their queue if they already exist on
	the glftpd site, without the need to refresh. This should minimize the
	number of 'dupe' errors as clients try to upload files that have
	already been uploaded by someone else to the current directory. When
	this is turned on (through 'site xdupe'), glftpd will give a list of
	files, preceded by the string "X-DUPE:", right before the usual "this
	file is a dupe" message. The files are first matched against a list
	of file masks on the "xdupe" line in glftpd.conf. See the included
	x-dupe-info.txt for more details. Currently, pftp is the only client
	which supports this feature.

	example config file entry:
	xdupe *.zip *.rar *.r[0-9][0-9] *.gz *.tgz *.arj

Special Cookie
--------------

%=FLAG/path/file	Display file only if user has FLAG enabled

	ex. %=123/ftp-data/text/site.help.nuke

	This would display the file 'site.help.nuke' to user with flags 1,2,3
	enabled.

Conditional Cookie
------------------

This is a cookie that works like an if/else statement. It will check whether
the user has flags or is in groups listed, and will print different chunks of
text based on the result.

Syntax: %?X,=group:text1:text2:?
	...where X is a flag, text1 is the text printed if user has access,
	and text2 is printed if not. "%?" is the beginning of the cookie, a
	single '?' is the end, and ':' is the field delimiter.

	The ':' and '?' characters must not be used as part of text1 or text2,
	since glftpd would confuse it with field delimiter or end of cookie.

	One flag or group is the minimum condition; multiple flags or groups,
	which can be mixed, must be separated by commas. The text1 and text2
	fields can be plain text, regular cookies, color cookies, or the
	%LOGOUT super-cookie.

        Example: %?1:You are a siteop, %[%s]Iu:You are not a siteop:?
        (this will print "You are a siteop, username" if user has flag 1, and
        "You are not a siteop" otherwise).

        Example: %?=disabled:Your account is disabled. %LOGOUT::?
        (this will log out users who are in group 'disabled', and will do
        nothing for everyone else).

        Example: Your comment is %?1,=STAFF:%[%s]I$:hidden:?.
        (this will print "Your comment is <comment>." for siteops and users in
        group STAFF, and "Your comment is hidden." for everyone else.

| VI. glftpd strings                 |
`------------------------------------'




Glftpd strings (keywords: glstrings, glstrings.bin)
---------------------------------------------------

Glstrings is the name of an external package that contains most of the reply
strings in glftpd. For example, when glftpd replies "user logged in" after
logging in, or "you do not have access to this command" if a user tries to
execute a command he has no access to, these responses are now taken from
the glstrings package instead of being hard-coded into the glftpd binary.

Glstrings was created in glftpd version 1.25 in Autumn 2001.

The default strings file, in binary format, is called glstrings.bin and it
resides in /glftpd/bin. Glftpd will by default try to read that file when a
user connects. If your glftpd is in a different location, you need to specify
the path to glstrings.bin on the command line (in inetd.conf or xinetd.conf).
Use the -s switch for that. Exmp: glftpd -l -o -i -s/glftpd/mystringsfile.bin

The rest of the glstrings package resides in /glftpd/bin/sources/glstrings.
It contains programs to compile and decompile the strings file, as well as
documentation for those who wish to modify default strings(replies).




.----------------------------------------.
|VII.  Glftpd directory & file structure |
`----------------------------------------'



1.  /glftpd/ftp-data:

The ftp-data directory is where most of the data is stored for the server.  It
contains subdirectories which contain most of the configurable files for help
as well as login/logout.  It also contains the logs and all the userfiles.

The following is an explanation of all subdirectories:

byefiles - Contains the text files displayed to the user when he/she has
           been deleted.  
help     - Contains all the help files displayed for all the commands used on the
           site.  The main file is site.help.  This file contains special cookies
           based on flags for displaying help files based on flags and/or groups.
logs     - Contains all the glftpd logs and directory/file databases.
misc     - Contains all the files for welcome, news, logoff as well as other
           configurable text files.
msgs     - Contains user messages (site msg)
text     - Contains all the header, body and footer files for all the stat
           commands as well as many other text files displayed on the site.
users    - Contains all of the userfiles.  See default.user for a description
           of all the fields in the userfiles.
groups	- Contains all of the groupfiles. See default.group for a description
	   of all the fields in the groupfiles.


Description of files in ftp-data/logs:

- binary files:
dirlog      - Contains all the directories created via the site.  This is used
              when executing `site new` or `site search`.  It should be updated
              if anything moves on the site.  Use glupdate to re-add new
              directories or to add directories not created through glftpd.
              glupdate is not recursive, so it must be executed on each
              directory containing directories you wish to add.  Use
              olddirclean2 to sort your dirlog and remove entries which no
              longer exist on disk.
laston	    - Contains all the user entries from people that logged in with their
	      actions.
nukelog     - Contains all the information on nuked directories.
dupefile    - Contains the dupe database for all files uploaded through glftpd.
oneliners   - Contains the onliners database.

- text files:
dupelog     - Contains the date and name of all directories made through
              glftpd. New entries are added to the bottom; old ones are never
              removed, so you may need to rotate this if it gets too big.
              This file is used by the 'site dupe' command.
error.log   - Contains errors that glftpd encounters, like bad homedirs etc.
              Siteops should examine this frequently (exmp: site errlog 5).
glftpd.log  - Contains many different actions taken by users, as described in
              the description of the -l command-line option. Many sitebots
              tail this file to announce user actions.
login.log   - Contains login failures due to incorrect IPs or passwds.
sysop.log   - Contains all siteop-made changes, like adding or removing users,
              ips, purging, killing, etc.
xferlog.log - Contains all the upload/download information for all files
              transferred (if logging of that is enabled). The format is the
              following: current time, transfer time, user's hostname, number
              of bytes sent, filename, 'a' if transfer was in ASCII mode or
              'b' if BINARY, _ (meaningless), 'i' if incoming (user uploading)
              or 'o' if outgoing (user downloading), 'r' (no meaning), user's
              name, user's group, 1 if user had ident or 0 if not, user's ident
request.log - Contains requests that were filled with 'site reqfilled'.



2.  /glftpd/etc:

The etc directory contains the passwd and group files.  This is also the 
place to store an additional copy of glftpd.conf for scripts that may want
to access it as well as anything else that usually resides in /etc that
you may need access to under chroot, ie: mtab so your df works under the site.

The following is an explanation of the passwd and group files:

passwd - This file contains the username, password, UID and home directory for
         each glftpd user.  The format is as follows:

         glftpd:6uwHOjJ3grid6:0:0:0:/site:/bin/false
         user:encrypted passwd:UID:GID:Creation Date:homedir:irrelevant

group  - This file contains all the group information for all your non-private
         groups.  The format is as follows:

         glftpd:glftpd:0:5
         short group name:long group name:GID:irrelevant
